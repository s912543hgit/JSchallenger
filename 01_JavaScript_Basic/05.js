// Write a function that takes a string (a) as argument
// Remove the first 3 characters of a
// Return the result
function myFunction(a) {
  return a.slice(3);
}

//hint

//With the slice method, you can extract a part of a string without modifying the original string. 
//You call it with two parameters (startIndex and endIndex). 
//startIndex defines the index of the first character in the string that you want to extract. 
//endIndex defines the first character that you do not want to extract.
