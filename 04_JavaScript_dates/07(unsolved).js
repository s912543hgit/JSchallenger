//Calculate difference between two dates in hours, minutes, and seconds

// This is a more difficult challenge
// Write a function that takes two date instances as arguments
// It should return an object with the properties 'hrs', 'min', and 'sec'
// The corresponding values should display the absolute difference between the two dates in hours, minutes, and seconds
function myFunction(a, b) {
  return;
